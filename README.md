A fully working sample Flutter app implementation. Give this repo a Star if you like it :)

- Layers separation (data, domain, logic, ui)
- Network calls and very simple caching and concurrency mechanism
- Generic error handling
- Forms validation
- Generic bloc structure
- RxDart
- Dependency injection
- Authentication with JWT and daily renewal
- Themes
- Multiple languages
- Named routes
- Named routes with parameters
- Names routes with simple permission control
- Analytics and pushes skeleton
- We have published [the API](https://api-sample.cingulo.com/docs) so that you can test the app
- Looks good but... it is still missing tests (TODO) :(

# Dependency Injection

This project uses [google/inject.dart](https://github.com/google/inject.dart). You will have to clone it under vendor/inject.dart:

```
    $ cd <repository-root>
    $ git clone https://github.com/google/inject.dart.git vendor/inject.dart
```

Edit `vendor/inject.dart/package/inject_generator/pubspec.yaml` and under `dependencies` set `analyzer: ^0.36.4` so that it will work with Flutter 1.10.7+

Use the command below to build the dependency injection:

```
    $ flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

- Done, you should now be good to run the app.
